Create a simple portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS.

Create an HTML structure for a portfolio site that has: 1) A picture wallpaper background, 2) a main section with project card elements, each card should have an image, a name heading, 2 paragraph elements describing them, and a description. All of this wrapped in a clickable <a href> tag with the value "cv1.html", 3) an AI search input and button, and a footer area. Link an external style sheet with name "styles2.css", "style4.css" and external JavaScript files "script4.js", and "background.js". Use the id 'background-canvas' for the canvas element and 'result' for the footer div.

Do a webpage that have search bar like google search bar at the middle of the screen with ai gemini integration with api key
A footer: the footer have results of the ai to show the results in the webpage footer 

combine the searchbar webpage with the portfolio webpages (the 5 cards first then the search bar above the footer )

Create an HTML page for a professional-looking employee Cv The CV should include the following sections, with appropriate headings and content:
A Header: At the very top, I need the person's name, "Youssef ahmed", in a big, noticeable heading. Right underneath that, I want their job title, "Software Developer," in a smaller paragraph.

Contact Info: Then, a section that clearly shows their contact details – like email, phone number, and links to their LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. Let's use a bulleted list for this section to make it clean.

Summary: After that, a short paragraph summarizing who they are and what they're good at.

Work Experience: I need a section listing their past jobs, with each job having its title, company name and dates, and a few bullet points describing what they did there. Let's put at least a couple of jobs in there.

Education: A section that details their degrees, with the degree titles and the university names/dates. Could you add at least two degrees?

Skills: Then, a straightforward bulleted list of the employee’s technical skills – like programming languages and stuff.

Projects: A list of their projects, each with a title and a short description, again using bullet points. Include a couple of projects here.
