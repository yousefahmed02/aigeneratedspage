Create a simple portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS. The webpage should have the following features:

HTML Structure:

A <header> section that includes a navigation bar with links to "Home," "Pages," "System Page," and "Blog."
A search bar in the navigation that allows users to search for content.
A main content area with three cards, each representing a project. Each card should have a title and a brief description.
A <footer> section that includes copyright information, links to "Terms of Service," "Privacy Policy," and "Contact Us," as well as social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Styling:

Use a background image for the body and sections, ensuring it covers the entire page and is centered.
Style the header to be fixed at the top with a transparent background and a blur effect.
Create a flexbox layout for the navigation items and the project cards to ensure they are evenly spaced and centered.
Style the cards with a fixed width and height, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow effect. Add a hover effect that increases the blur and shadow.
Ensure the footer has a subtle shadow and is styled to be visually distinct from the main content.
Typography:

Use a clean, sans-serif font (like Arial) for the entire webpage.
Set appropriate font sizes and colors for the titles, text, and footer.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.
Additional Features:

Include hover effects for navigation links and buttons.
Use CSS properties like backdrop-filter for blurring effects in the header and footer.
